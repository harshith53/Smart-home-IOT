# Smart-home-IOT
Using the concept of IOT build a project for SOLVE4BHARTH PAN-IIT 2020 Hackathon 
Which won a special prize


This project is mainly made to help disabled and blind people who
plan to live independently without any support!
Blind people won’t feel alone anymore!
More than 15% of the entire population and every 1 in 7 people have
some kind of disability. By implementing this idea, the lives of more
than 1 billion people can be changed.
Our project could be a ray of hope for people with disabilities.


This project not only helps adults but also helps for sustainable
development. What is sustainable development? “Sustainable
development is the development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs”
[1] To simply put in words, it is the development where we
preserve the resources for future generations. Nearly 30% of the
energy is being wasted without any use. The sensors used in this
project helps to save electricity by turning off electrical devices in the
house when not in use. The App MATE also collects data regarding
the usage of electricity
